*Last modified: July 30, 2022*

### I-i. About the Company
**Cyclistic** is a hypothetical bike-share company in Chicago founded in 2016, featuring 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. To foster inclusivity for diverse groups of customers, Cyclistic not only offers conventional two-wheeled bicycles, but also hand tricycles, reclining bicycles, and cargo bicycles. According to Cyclistic's bike trip data, approximately 30% of the bike-share users use the bikes to commute to work. 

### I-ii. Goal of the Design Marketing Strategy
The key stakeholder, Lily Moreno, or the director of marketing at Cyclistic, hypothesizes that increasing the number of annual membership bike-share users will lead to a greater success of the company. Hence, the ultimate goal of the marketing team is to recommend new marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members by scrutinizing data insights with captivating data visualizations. The new marketing strategies will be developed based on the three questions below:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bicycles differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

The case study will focus on the first question for the data analysis.

### II. Business Task
A business task is a question we want to answer through data analysis and make data-driven decisions for business strategies. In this scenario, the business task is to analyze Cyclistic's rider data from the previous 12 months to identify the difference between casual riders and annual members.
